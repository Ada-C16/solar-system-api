# Solar System API

# Build
Clone the forked repo and cd into it

Recreate the following setup steps of the Solar System API repo:

    Create a virtual environment and activate it
    Install the dependencies
    Define a Planet class with the attributes id, name, and description, and one additional attribute
    Create a list of Planet instances
    
Create the following endpoints, with similar functionality presented in the Hello Books API:

    As a client, I want to send a request to get all existing planets, so that I can see a list of planets, with their id, name, description, and other data of the planet.
    As a client, I want to send a request to get one existing planet, so that I can see the id, name, description, and other data of the planet.
    Here is a minimal setup for a Flask API.

## Github Setup

1. One person should fork this repo
1. Then, add all group members as _collaborators_ to this forked repo
1. All group members should clone this new, forked, group repo

## Tips

- Don't forget to work in a virtual environment
- Put endpoints in `app/routes.py`
- Add configuration, such as registering blueprints or configuring databases, in `app/__init__.py`
- Commit and push often

## Guidelines for Pair-Programming

- The driver is the person who is at the keyboard and mouse
- The navigator is the person who is thinking out loud, actively collaborating with the driver about the next step, and helping guide the development
- Trade-off driver and navigator roles often
- Take time to make sure you're on the same page
